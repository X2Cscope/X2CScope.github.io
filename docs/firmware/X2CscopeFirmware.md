There are 3 ways to integrate X2Cscope to your application:
1. MPLAB Code Configurator
   * 16bit Microchip MCUs like dsPIC33CK
2. Harmony 3 configurator
   * 32bit MCUs like PIC32MZ or SAME54
3. Bare matal integration for custom projects
   * If your code is already available and no configurator tool is used. 
   * Or for engeneers who are believing only in their own handwritten code.
